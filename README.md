# Node SVG Logo Generator Challenge-10

## Description
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating an SVG generator to create simple logos for web development projects. Similarly to my command line README generator, to do this I used node.js, a prompt using inquirer for user input, and used functions to render that information from the prompt's user input using template literals in the appropiate markdown for an SVG file.

- To begin, run node index.js or npm run start.

- Your generated SVG file will appear under the examples folder in the directory, under the name of your logo as you entered it. 'name.svg'
